-------------------INTRODUCTION-------------------

iFood is the leading food delivery company in Brazil and Colombia

Several previous campaigns have not been as effective as expected. As a result, the company lost more on advertising than it earned.

In total, 2240 clients have participated in the campaigns

-------------------GOAL-------------------

The main goal of the project is to research the course of the campaign and offer insights/solutions for their further improvement.

-------------------TASKS-------------------

This project will consist of three parts:
1. Data Exploration
   - Are there empty values/outliers in the data? How should they be treated?
   - Is there a need to change the original values? (e.g. change the type of variables, bring them to a common form, add the type of variables "date", etc.)
   - Is it possible to generalize the initial values and get useful information from them?
   - Are there patterns/anomalies in the data?
2. Statistical analysis
   Using statistical methods, give answers to the following questions:
   - What factors affect the number of store purchases ?
   - Does the U.S. lead in terms of total purchases compared to other countries?
   - There is an assumption that customers who spend an above-average amount on gold products have a higher number of store purchases. Is this really so?
   - Fish contains the Omega 3 acids, which have a positive effect on brain activity. Therefore, is there a correlation between married clients with PhD and spending on fish products? What other factors affect the amount of spending on fish products?
   - Is there a significant correlation between the region and the success of the campaign?
3. Data visualization
   - Which marketing campaign was the most successful?
   - What does the average client of this company look like?
   - Which products are in the greatest demand?
   - Which shopping method is the least popular?
